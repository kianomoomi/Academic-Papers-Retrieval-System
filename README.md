# Academic-Papers-Retrieval-System
This is an information retrieval system for academic papers that has advanced features and can retrieve and recommend papers to the user using Machine Learning methods. It is implemented in Python and required libraries and packages are listed at the beginning of every section. It consists of three phases which I will elaborate on:
## Phases of the system
- [Phase 1: classic information retrieval system](#Phase-1:-Classic-information-retrieval-system)
- [Phase 2: Adding Machine Learning methods to the system](#Phase-2:-Adding-Machine-Learning-methods-to-the-system)
- [Phase 3: Adding web crawler to the system and build a personalized search engine using recommender systems](#phase-3:-Adding-web-crawler-to-the-system-and-build-a-personalized-search-engine-using-recommender-systems)
